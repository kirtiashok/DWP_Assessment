Here's a cloud architecture diagram for hosting a 3-tier application in AWS. It includes the following components:

1.Presentation Tier: Load Balancer, Web Servers for handling user requests.
2.Application Tier: Application Servers and API Gateway for business logic processing.
3.Data Tier: Database Cluster and Data Storage for persistent storage and access.


Key strategies for high availability and scalability:
Auto-scaling for Web and Application servers.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for traffic distribution.
Database clustering and replication for fault tolerance.
Security Considerations:
IAM for access control.
VPC for network isolation and secure communication.
Encryption for data protection.

Monitoring and management tools:
AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.
AWS Config and CloudTrail for configuration management and logging.
This design ensures scalability, high availability, and robust security for the application.
